# 0x16 ALX SIMPLE SHELL TEST SUITE

Credit: Cloned from early iterations of [Fuzzworth's test suite](httpthe://github.com/Fuzzworth/alx_test_suite).

## DESCRIPTION

- This is a set of testing scripts for all simple shell tasks except Betty and memory checks with Valgrind.
- This suite is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 WSL.

## FEATURES

- Runs a checker on your compiled code and displays `OK` if you have the expected output.
- Displays command to be executed before it starts.
- Displays the number of `OK` outputs at the end and a total number of commands run.
- Check only specific tasks instead of the whole suite at once.

*DISCLAIMER: Currently cannot check for valgrind errors so you must do that manually. If you get OK and also no memory leaks then expect GREEN on the Intranet. If you get OK and you have memory errors you will get RED in the intranet.*

## HOW TO USE

 Copy & paste each highlighted command to your terminal and press `enter â†²` one after the other

1. `https://github.com/LaughingRover/SIMPLE_SHELL_TEST_SUITE.git` clone this repo into your simple_shell directory
2. Move the TEST_SUITE directory to your simple_shell directory
3. `cd TEST_SUITE` - Navigate into the TEST_SUITE directory
4. `chmod +x checker.bash runchecker.bash` - make them executable
5. `mv runchecker.bash ../runchecker.bash` - move runchecker.bash to your simple_shell directory.
6. `cd ..` - Navigate back to simple_shell.
7. Remove the residue files.
8. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repo if you don't already have one and add these lines inside it

```gitignore
TEST_SUITES
allowed_functions
runchecker.bash
```

8. `./runchecker.bash` - to run the whole suite from tasks 1 - 16 at once.

--- OPTIONS ---

`./runchecker.bash #`

replace # with a number from 1- 16 to only run checks from a specific task e.g. to check task 3 only, do `./runchecker.bash 3`

#### Step 1: Clone repository

```bash
https://github.com/LaughingRover/SIMPLE_SHELL_TEST_SUITE.git
```

then,

```bash
cd SIMPLE_SHELL_TEST_SUITE
```

#### Step 2: Create a local branch

```bash
git checkout -b enhancement/<local_branch_name>
```

or

```bash
git branch enhancement/<local_branch_name>
git checkout enhancement/<local_branch_name>
```

#### Step 3: Make your updates

> - DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE FILES IN THE DIRECTORIES NAMED 1 - 16
> - DO NOT MODIFY the checker.bash

#### Step 4: Commit using the below template

Follow the instructions for the template here: [Original post](https://gist.github.com/lisawolderiksen/a7b99d94c92c6671181611be1641c733)

An easy way to get this config using a single command:

```bash
printf "# Title: Summary, imperative, start upper-case, don't end with a period\n# No more than 50 chars. #### 50 chars is here:  #\n\n# Remember blank line between title and body.\n\n# Body: Explain *what* and *why* (not *how*). Include task ID (Jira issue).\n# Wrap at 72 chars. ################################## which is here:  #\n\n\n# At the end: Include Co-authored-by for all contributors. \n# Include at least one empty line before it. Format: \n# Co-authored-by: name <user@users.noreply.github.com>\n#\n# How to Write a Git Commit Message:\n# https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\n#\n# 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n# 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n# 3. Capitalize the subject line\n# 4. Do not end the subject line with a period\n# 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line\n# 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n# 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n" > ~/.gitmessage && git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

then,

```bash
git config commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

then,

```bash
git commit
```

**Do not use!!!**

```bash
git commit -m "message"
